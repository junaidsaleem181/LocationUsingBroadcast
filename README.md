This is a real time Java Android Geofencing application which gets the location using the boradcast receiver. Geofencing is used in order to check if user enters 
particular area or not. In this application we get the longitude and lattitude of the current location of the user and if it falls within 
our fence we show a toast showing a message "You have entered here (location)!". In our case its "You have entered FAST!" as an example.
